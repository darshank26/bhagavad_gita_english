  "\"Shri Bhagavan said, 'I shall now reveal to you this most secretive knowledge and wisdom, knowing which you shall be liberated from the miseries of material existence. This knowledge is combined with realized experience, and by understanding it, you shall be freed from the cycle of birth and death.'\"",
  "This knowledge is the king of education, the most secret of all secrets. It is the purest knowledge, and because it gives direct perception of the self by realization, it is the perfection of religion. It is everlasting, and it is joyfully performed.",
  "Those who are not faithful in this devotional service cannot attain Me, O conqueror of enemies. Therefore they return to the path of birth and death in this material world.",
  "By Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded. All beings are in Me, but I am not in them.",
  "And yet everything that is created does not rest in Me. Behold My mystic opulence! Although I am the maintainer of all living entities, and although I am everywhere, still My Self is the very source of creation.",
  "As the mighty wind, blowing everywhere, rests always in the sky, in the same way, all beings rest in Me.",
  "O son of Kunti, all created beings enter into My nature at the end of a cycle of time; and I create them again at the beginning of the next cycle.",
  "By Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded. All beings are in Me, but I am not in them.",
  "The quote means detachment, or being unattached to the results of one's actions, as Lord Krishna advises Arjuna to perform his duties in the same way.",
  "Under My supervision, nature produces all moving and nonmoving beings. O son of Kunti (Arjuna), for this reason, the material world revolves.",
  "Fools disregard Me, when I take on a human form, not knowing My supreme nature as the great Lord of all beings.",
  "Those with deluded minds, who engage in futile actions, who lack discrimination and who are under the spell of demoniac and atheistic views, are inclined towards demoniac and atheistic forms of nature.",
  "O Arjuna, great souls who have taken refuge in My divine nature worship Me with a single-minded devotion, knowing Me as the immutable source of all beings.",
  "Always singing My glories, striving with great determination, bowing down before Me with devotion, they remain ever steadfast in worshiping Me.",
  "Others worship Me through the sacrifice of knowledge, with the realization that all beings are one in Me and I am in them, while still others worship Me as the universal form, with the various rituals prescribed in the Vedas.",
  "I am the ritual, I am the sacrifice, I am the offering to the ancestors, I am the medicinal herb, I am the mantra, I am the clarified butter, I am the fire, and I am the act of offering.",
