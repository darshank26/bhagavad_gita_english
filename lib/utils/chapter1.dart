"Sanjaya said: O King, after seeing the army of the Pandavas arrayed in battle formation, King Duryodhana approached his teacher Dronacharya and spoke the following words:",
  "O teacher, behold this mighty army of the sons of Pandu, arranged in battle formation by your wise disciple, the son of Drupada.",
  "Here in this army are many heroic bowmen equal in fighting to Bhima and Arjuna: great fighters like Yuyudhana, Virata and Drupada.",
  "There are also great warriors like Dhrishtaketu, Chekitana, the valiant king of Kashi, Purujit, Kuntibhoja, and Shaibya.",
