  "I shall now declare unto thee again that supreme wisdom, the best of all knowledge, knowing which all the sages have attained to supreme perfection after this life.",
  "Taking refuge in this knowledge of Mine, those who have attained My nature are not reborn even during creation, nor do they suffer during dissolution.",
  "My womb is the great Brahman (the ultimate reality), and in that I place the germ (of all beings). From that, O Arjuna, comes the birth of all beings.",
  "Whatever forms are born from all the different kinds of wombs, O Arjuna, the great Brahman is their womb and I am the seed-giving father.",
  "The three qualities - sattva (goodness), rajas (passion), and tamas (ignorance) - born of nature, O mighty-armed Arjuna, bind fast the immutable embodied soul in the body.",
  "Of these, the mode of goodness, which is pure, illuminating and free from disease, binds the soul by creating attachment to happiness and knowledge, O sinless one.",
  "Know that the mode of passion is characterized by desire and attachment to fruitive work, O Arjuna. It binds the embodied soul to material objects by means of attachment to the results of activities.",
  "O Arjuna, know that ignorance-born tamas produces delusion for all embodied beings. It binds them with the ropes of negligence, indolence and sleep.",
  "O Arjuna, sattva binds one to happiness, rajas to action, while tamas, covering knowledge, binds one to delusion in negligence.",
  "O Arjuna, by predominance of rajas, tamas, or sattva, the qualities of those modes are generated. The nature of sattva arises from predominance over rajas and tamas, rajas arises from predominance over sattva and tamas, and tamas arises from predominance over sattva and rajas.",
  "When the light of knowledge illuminates all the gates of the body, then it is said that the person has attained a state of purity and goodness (sattva).",
  "Desire, activity, and restlessness arise when Rajas is dominant, O Arjuna. These qualities cause a person to be attached to action, result in excessive striving, and are the source of craving.",
  "Increased tamas (darkness) gives rise to qualities such as lack of illumination, inactivity, negligence, and delusion, O Arjuna!",
  "When the embodied being passes beyond the three modes of material nature (goodness, passion, and ignorance) which are the source of the body, he attains to the pure transcendental knowledge and reaches the stage of supreme peace, in which the soul attains everlasting happiness.",
  "When one perishes in Rajas, the cause of activity, the world of the active is born; in the same way, when one perishes in Tamas, the deluded darkness is born in the world.",
  "They say that the fruit of good action is pure and consists of sattva, while the fruit of action born of rajas is pain and the fruit of action born of tamas is ignorance.",
