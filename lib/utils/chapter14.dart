  "I shall now declare unto thee again that supreme wisdom, the best of all knowledge, knowing which all the sages have attained to supreme perfection after this life.",
  "Taking refuge in this knowledge of Mine, those who have attained My nature are not reborn even during creation, nor do they suffer during dissolution.",
  "My womb is the great Brahman (the ultimate reality), and in that I place the germ (of all beings). From that, O Arjuna, comes the birth of all beings.",
  "Whatever forms are born from all the different kinds of wombs, O Arjuna, the great Brahman is their womb and I am the seed-giving father.",
  "The three qualities - sattva (goodness), rajas (passion), and tamas (ignorance) - born of nature, O mighty-armed Arjuna, bind fast the immutable embodied soul in the body.",
  "Of these, the mode of goodness, which is pure, illuminating and free from disease, binds the soul by creating attachment to happiness and knowledge, O sinless one.",
  "Know that the mode of passion is characterized by desire and attachment to fruitive work, O Arjuna. It binds the embodied soul to material objects by means of attachment to the results of activities.",
  "O Arjuna, know that ignorance-born tamas produces delusion for all embodied beings. It binds them with the ropes of negligence, indolence and sleep.",
